Education has been a central activity in my career for several years, and I am continually striving to gain experience teaching in a wide variety of settings (from high schoolers and the general public to active researchers) and improve my skills through workshops and professional development.

Some of my long-term goals are to help reform STEM education to be based more on evidence-based research, and integrate computational skills into the standard curricula.
