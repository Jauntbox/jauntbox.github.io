<h3>Computational stellar/planetary evolution</h3>

<p>The open open-source stellar evolution code, <a href=http://mesa.sourceforge.net>MESA</a>, was written by <a href=http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/members/PM/paxton/index.html>Bill Paxton</a> while I was a grad student at UCSB. I've been using this code for several years for various projects on stellar/planetary modeling as well as in external codes. I've lead several bootcamps on the code at various institutions, used it extensively for education in graduate stellar evolution courses, and participated (most recently as a lecturer) in all three MESA Summer Schools so far. I'm currently interested in implementing improved mixing models for convective and semiconvective mixing applied to stellar and planetary interiors, as well as helium core flash models, modeling rotating stars, and asteroseismic inferences of internal structure.</p>
