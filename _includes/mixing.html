<h3>Hydrodynamic simulations of mixing processes in stars and planets</h3>

<p>Computational stellar evolution is limited by the extremely long time scales that stars evolve on. This makes explicitly modeling dynamical processes such as convection impossible over the course of a star's lifetime. Instead, one-dimensional parametrizations of the mean thermal and compositional transport rates are employed, such as mixing length theory. Recently, precision observations of stars over long periods have enabled constraints on the internal structures of stars based on their pulsation modes. For example, we can tell whether red giant stars are burning He in their cores or not, and how fast the core is rotating relative to the envelope. There are currently large discrepancies between observations and models of core/envelope rotation rates, as well as deep interior mixing. Direct numerical simulations of stellar interiors can allow us to formulate new prescriptions for stellar models. We're currently working on 3D simulations to model semiconvective mixing in stars, helium rain in gas giant planets, and magnetic coupling between stellar cores and envelopes.</p>
