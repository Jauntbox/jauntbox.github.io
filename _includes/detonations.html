<h3>Helium detonations on accreting white dwarfs</h3>

<p>Several different helium accretion scenarios in evolved binary systems can allow for dynamically unstable helium envelopes to build up on top of white dwarfs. These helium envelopes may burn via deflagrations (subsonic burning) or detonations (supersonic burning). Recent work on ignition and propagation of these detonation waves indicates that they could to develop in convectively burning helium shells and double white dwarf mergers. Such detonations would sweep across the surface of the white dwarf, ejecting burned material into space and also sending shock waves into the underlying white dwarf. These shock waves could focus in the white dwarf and ignite a second detonation if the white dwarf is composed of C/O - possibly producing a Type Ia supernova (the double-detonation scenario). If the underlying white dwarf is more massive, composed of O/Ne/Mg, then only the surface layers may detonate - creating a much smaller outburst. I'm currently interested in modeling the ignition and propagation of detonations in the accreted helium envelopes as well as possible progenitor systems.</p>
