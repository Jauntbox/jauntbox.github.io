##About me

<!-- ![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Moore_400.jpg) -->

I'm currently a postdoc at UCSC working with Pascale Garaud in the Applied Mathematics & Statistics department and Jonathan Fortney in the Astronomy & Astrophysics deparment. Prior to coming here, I was a physics grad student several hours down the California coast at UCSB and worked with Lars Bildsten on aspects of theoretical astrophysics such as explosion remnants, detonations, and asteroseismology. Before that I was an undergrad in physics at Cornell University in the frigid and wonderful wilderness of upstate NY. Even before that, I grew up on the east coast in the suburbs of Philly.

### More Information

Aside from sciencing, I try to maintain sanity by  biking, surfing, brewing (and drinking) beer, cooking, and slowly forgetting the Japanese I learned (嫌だな). You can still find my old Japanese blog [here](http://jauntbox.blogspot.com).
